Singly Linked List: Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. Traversal is only possible in one direction.
Doubly Linked List: Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node. Traversal is possible in both directions.
Circular Linked List: In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, creating a loop. Traversal can continue indefinitely.


Head & Tail Management: Always maintain the head (and tail in doubly and circular lists) to avoid traversing the entire list when accessing the first or last elements.
Null Checks: Before performing operations like deletion or traversal, check if the list is empty to prevent errors.
Efficient Insertion/Deletion: Insert at the beginning or end for O(1) time complexity. For operations in the middle, ensure proper pointer updates to maintain list integrity.
Memory Management: Properly nullify pointers (next, prev) when deleting nodes to prevent memory leaks, especially in languages without garbage collection.
Boundary Handling: Carefully handle edge cases like inserting/deleting at the head, tail, or middle of the list, ensuring correct pointer updates.
Avoid Infinite Loops (Circular Lists): Implement conditions to stop traversal after one complete cycle to avoid infinite loops.
