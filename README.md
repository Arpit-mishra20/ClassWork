This assignment outlines best programming practices, emphasizing encapsulation, polymorphism, interfaces, and abstract classes. It includes practical examples such as an Employee Management System, E-Commerce Platform, Vehicle Rental System, and more. Each example demonstrates the application of these principles, ensuring code maintainability, readability, and flexibility through proper design patterns.
-*Encapsulation*: Ensure all sensitive fields are private and accessed through well-defined getter and setter methods. Include validation logic where applicable.<br>
-*Polymorphism*: Use abstract class references or interface references to handle objects of multiple types dynamically.<br>
-*Abstract Classes*: Use them to define a common structure and behavior while deferring specific details to subclasses.<br>
-*Interfaces*: Use them to define additional capabilities or contracts that are not tied to the class hierarchy.<br>
