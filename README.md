Java Generics allow developers to write flexible and reusable code while maintaining type safety. Generics enable classes, interfaces, and methods to operate on parameterized types, reducing runtime errors by shifting type checking to compile-time.

Wildcards in Generics

Wildcards (?) allow flexibility in specifying unknown types:

(Unbounded wildcard)
(Upper-bounded wildcard)
(Lower-bounded wildcard)
Java Generics provide a powerful way to create reusable, type-safe code. By leveraging generics, developers can build robust applications with fewer runtime errors and improved maintainability.
