Bubble Sort Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.

Insertion Sort Insertion Sort works by building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time by picking an element and inserting it at the correct position within the sorted portion.

Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer) Merge Sort follows the Divide and Conquer approach, where an array is recursively divided into two halves, sorted individually, and merged back together.

Quick Sort (Divide and Conquer) Quick Sort is another Divide and Conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around it, and recursively sorts the left and right sub-arrays.
