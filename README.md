Runtime Analysis - Runtime analysis evaluates how an algorithm's performance (time and space) scales with input size. The goal is to determine the efficiency of an algorithm before actual implementation.
Big-O Notation - Big-O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's complexity, representing the worst-case scenario in terms of execution time and space required.
Common Big-O Notations O(1) - Constant Time O(log N) -Logarithmic Time O(N) - Linear Time O(N log N) - Linearithmic Time O(NÂ²) - Quadratic Time O(2^N) - Exponential Time O(N!) - Factorial Time
